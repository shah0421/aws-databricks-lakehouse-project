# 📘 ETL Lakehouse Workflow Project With PySpark
## Medallion Architecture + Terraform Infrastructure

This is exactly the same project as ETL Lakehouse Workflow Project but the only difference is in this project, pySpark has been used to ingest/transform data instead of raw SQL, This project demonstrates an end-to-end **AWS Databricks Lakehouse** implementation, including:

- Automated infrastructure provisioning using **Terraform**
- Ingesting data from **multiple sources & formats**
- Applying the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze → Silver → Gold)
- Building analytics-ready **Gold Layer** tables for BI & ML
- Integration with **S3, IAM, Secrets Manager, JDBC**
- Using **Unity Catalog** for secure governance

All AWS resources required for Databricks + S3 access are provisioned using Terraform following IAM and security best practices.
